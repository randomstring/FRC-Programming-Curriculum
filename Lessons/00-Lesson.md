# Lesson 0

The goal of this homework assignment is to create a working
development environment so you can write code and run it on a FRC
robot. 

If you don't have access to a computer at home, the team and the
schools have computers for use durings meetings and in their libraries
or computer labs.

If you get stuck or aren't sure how to proceed, ask me or the rest of
the subteam for help!

# Account setup
    
Our team uses several different services to store and track changes in
    our code and to communicate with our fellow programmers.
    
1. [Github](<https://github.com/>) to store our code, track changes,
   and collaborate
2. [Slack](<https://slack.com/>) (To be deprecated when Teams is set
   up) is a chat service used by our whole robotics team. We have a
   dedicated #programming channel for sharing programming
   announcements, discussions, and asking for help. Our team also uses
   Slack to communicate during events and competitions.
3. [Microsoft Office 365/Teams](<https://login.microsoftonline.com/>) is a
   suite of services in which we are going to be moving into during
   the offseason to potentially replace Slack. This service has all of
   Slack's features as well as Email, online meetings, file sharing,
   as well as it being operated by one of our sponsors! To get an
   account, contact Jason Reiner and he can get you set up.
    
Start by going to <https://github.com/join> and creating an
account. When choosing an account name and avatar, keep in mind your
GitHub account will be visible to all and should meet team and school
standards. Github is also a good way to share your work with others
and can act as a coding resume. Next, email your GitHub username to
your programming lead and/or mentor so they can grant you access to
your team's Github repositories (that's what Github calls a project
folder).
	
Next, you will need to join Slack and the #programming
sub-channel. The easiest way to do this is to email the team
(sonicsquirrels@gmail.com) and ask to be added. Make sure you include
your name and email in the message so the admin knows who you are.
    
If you already have a Slack account and are on the Team Slack work
space <https://sonicsquirrels.slack.com/> then add yourself to the
programming channel by sending the slack message "/join #programming".
    
Slack has a desktop app and also native apps for the iPhone and
Android.

For Microsoft Teams, if you arent already added to the groups inside the team,
let Bryn or Jason know and they can add you to the group. This will autojoin you to the
group chat channels that programming uses.

Teams has a desktop app and also native apps for the iPhone and
Android.

While you're waiting to get added to the team's accounts, take a
moment to browse your team's code on Github. Team 2930's code resides
at <https://github.com/FRC-Sonic-Squirrels/> and last year's robot
code is at <https://github.com/FRC-Sonic-Squirrels/FRC-2019-Public>

# Software Installation Requirements
    
Next we need to setup the development environment on your
      computer. This is a set of tools for editing, building, testing,
      and deploying code. The software is all free. The tools we will
      install are:
    
1. *VS Code* This is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that
        is a file editor with added intelligence that understands the code
        you write and helps automates much of the process of editing,
        debugging, and running programs.
2. *FIRST supplied tools* These include programs for generating
        robot programs using an interactive GUI (Graphical User
        Interface), a robot path planner, WPIlib (code that controls
        the robots motors and sensors), a Java Runtime Environment,
        and Shuffleboard (a tool for monitoring what's happening on the
        robot.) Don't worry about the details yet. What you need to know is
        this is code that gets used by VS Code and the robot and makes
        our work *much* easier.
3.  *GitHub desktop* This is a GUI for working with code stored on
        github.com. Most of your interactions with GitHub will be handled
        by VS Code and this installs the programs VS Code will use behind
        the scenes.
    
To install the software you'll need a computer or access to
one. Pretty much any PC, Mac, or Linux computer or laptop will work. A
laptop you can bring to programming meetings is ideal. Almost any
laptop, even very old and slow ones, will work. The team has a few
laptops that can be shared. The team can help you setup an old cast
off laptop. And our high schools have libraries and computer labs for
after-school computer time.
	  
If you don't have a laptop that you can bring to meetings, we're
working on possible solutions to allow students to keep their working
environment on a portable thumb drive. If this sounds useful to you,
speak up so we can put time into making this solution work for anyone.
    
Your laptop will need WiFi in order to connect to the school network
and also to connect to the robot. A USB 2.0/3.0 port is useful for
hardwired connections to the robot. Having an Ethernet port, or
USB-to-Ethernet adapter, is a nice to have but not necessary.

## Software Installation
    
Follow the instructions outlined here. Note, the main instruction is
to follow the link to wpilib.screenstepslive.com and follow the
detailed instructions there.
    
<https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases>
    
You start by downloading the appropriate software bundle for your
      computer and operating system. To do this scroll down to the
      section of the page that looks like this:

![Download links look like this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/randomstring/FRC-Programming-Curriculum/master/Lessons/imgs/Download_Links.png)

Here is a direct link to the newer instructions from frc-readthedocs.io site:
<https://frc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/wpilib-setup.html>

Here's a YouTube video installation
guide: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWf_4dxKpT8> NOTE: This video
is from January 2019, some file names will have changed due to new
software releases.

### GitHub Desktop

Next install the GitHub desktop software:

# Advanced Topics
    
If you don't have a laptop you can try to install all the software
      onto a portable thumb drive or some other type of portable
      media. This will let you carry your entire programming
      environment with you. You just need to borrow a computer with
      the same operating system and run VS Code directly from your
      thumb drive. The school has sets of classroom laptops we could
      use for this purpose.
    
WARNING: We haven't actually tried this yet!
