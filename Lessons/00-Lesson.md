# Homework Lesson 1<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

The goal of this homework assignment is to have a working developement
environment so you can write code and run it on a FRC robot.

1.  Account setup

Our team uses several differant services to store and track changes in
our code and to communicate with our fellow programmers.

1.  [Github](<https://github.com/>) to store our code, track changes,
    and collaborate

Start by going to <https://github.com/join> and creating an
account. When choosing an account name and avatar, keep in mind your
github account will be visible to all. Github is also a good way to
share your work with others and can act as a coding resume. Next
email your github username to your programming lead and/or mentor so
they can grant you access to your team's Github repositories (that's
what Github calls aproject folder).

While you're waiting to get added to the team's accounts, take a
moment to browse your team's code on Github. Team 5113's code
resides at <https://github.com/FRC5113/> 

If you're on a different team, try Googling "FRC <your team nuber>
github.com"


1.  Software Installation
    -   what you'll need: a computer. PC, Mac, or Linux will work. Idealy a
        laptop you can bring to programming and engineering
        meetings. Almost any laptop, even very old and slow ones, will
        work. The team has a few laptops that can be shared. The team can
        help you setup an old cast off laptop. A really expensive gaming
        laptop can be a liability!
    -   Need: 
        -   WiFi to connect to school network and the robot
        -   a standard USB port, for wired connections to the robot
    -   Nice to have: 
        +Ethernet port (or USB-to-ehternet adapter)

-   URL instruction, just follow directions
-   hints on wich bundles you want to download
-   warnings about potential problems
    -   don't wait to download at school, network is slow
    -   installing Java
-   reminder to ask for help

-   TODO instructions for installing onto a thumbdrive.

-   students will be provided with instructions on how to install all the needed software.
-   YouTube Videos
-   GOALS:
    -   FRC utilities installed
    -   VS Code installed
    -   GitHub account
    -   clone Robot code
    -   build Robot code
    -   run driver station
