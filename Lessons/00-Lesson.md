# Lesson 0

The goal of this homework assignment is to have a working development
environment so you can write code and run it on a FRC robot.

If you get stuck or aren't sure how to proceed ask for help!

# Account setup
    
Our team uses several different services to store and track changes in
    our code and to communicate with our fellow programmers.
    
1.  [Github](<https://github.com/>) to store our code, track changes,
        and collaborate
2.  [Slack](<https://slack.com/>) is a chat service used by our team,
        we have a #programming channel for sharing programming
        announcements, discussion, and asking for help. Our team also uses
        Slack to communicate during events and competitions.
    
Start by going to <https://github.com/join> and creating an
    account. When choosing an account name and avatar, keep in mind
    your GitHub account will be visible to all. Github is also a good
    way to share your work with others and can act as a coding
    resume. Next email your GitHub username to your programming lead
    and/or mentor so they can grant you access to your team's Github
    repositories (that's what Github calls a project folder).  Next is
    joining Slack and the #programming sub-channel. The easiest way to
    do this is to email the team (sonicsquirrels@gmail.com) and ask to
    be added. Make sure you include your name and email in the message
    so the admin knows who you are.
    
If you already have a Slack account and are on the Team Slack work
    space <https://sonicsquirrels.slack.com/> then add yourself to the
    programming channel by sending the slack message "/join #programming".
    
Slack has a desktop app and also native apps for the iPhone and
    Android.
    
While you're waiting to get added to the team's accounts, take a
    moment to browse your team's code on Github. Team 2930's code
    resides at <https://github.com/FRC-Sonic-Squirrels/> and last
    year's robot code is
    at <https://github.com/FRC-Sonic-Squirrels/FRC-2019-Public>
    
If you're on a different team, try Googling "FRC YOURTEAMNUMBER

# Software Installation Requirements
    
Next we need to setup the development environment on your
      computer. This is a set of tools for editing, building, testing,
      and deploying code. The software is all free. The tools we will
      install are:
    
1. *VS Code* This is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that
        is a file editor with added intelligence that understands the code
        you write and helps automates much of the process of editing,
        debugging, and running programs.
2. *FIRST supplied tools* These include programs for generating
        robot programs using an interactive GUI (Graphical User
        Interface), a robot path planner, WPIlib (code that controls
        the robots motors and sensors), a Java Runtime Environment,
        and Shuffleboard a tool for monitoring what's happening on the
        robot. Don't worry about the details. What you need to know is
        this is code that gets used by VS Code and the robot and makes
        our work *much* easier.
3.  *GitHub desktop* This is a GUI for working with code stored on
        github.com. Most of your interactions with GitHub will be handled
        by VS Code and this installs the programs VS Code will use behind
        the scenes.
    
To install the software you'll need a computer. Pretty much any PC,
      Mac, or Linux computer or laptop will work. A laptop you can
      bring to programming meetings is ideal. Almost any laptop, even
      very old and slow ones, will work. The team has a few laptops
      that can be shared. The team can help you setup an old cast off
      laptop. 
	  
If you don't have a laptop, we're working on possible solutions to
allow students to keep their working environment on a portable thumb
drive. If this sounds useful to you, speak up so we can put time into
making this solution work for anyone.
    
Your laptop will need WiFi in order to connect to the school network
      and also to connect to the robot. A USB 2.0/3.0 port is useful
      for hardwired connections to the robot. Having an Ethernet port,
      or USB-to-Ethernet adapter, is a nice to have but not necessary.

## Software Installation
    
Follow the instructions outlined here. Note, the main instruction is
      to follow the link to wpilib.screenstepslive.com and follow the
      detailed instructions there.
    
<https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases>
    
You start by downloading the appropriate software bundle for your
      computer and operating system. To do this scroll down to the
      section of the page that looks like this:

![Download links look like this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/randomstring/FRC-Programming-Curriculum/master/Lessons/imgs/Download_Links.png)

Here's a YouTube video installation
guide: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWf_4dxKpT8> NOTE: This video
is from January 2019, some file names will have changed due to new
software releases.

### GitHub Desktop

Next install the GitHub desktop software:

# Next Steps

## Getting a Copy of the Robot Code

Clone the repo. 

## Build the Robot Code

Instructions for building the robot code go here.

 
# Advanced Topics
    
If you don't have a laptop you can try to install all the software
      onto a portable thumb drive or some other type of portable
      media. This will let you carry your entire programming
      environment with you. You just need to borrow a computer with
      the same operating system and run VS Code directly from your
      thumb drive. The school has sets of classroom laptops we could
      use for this purpose.
