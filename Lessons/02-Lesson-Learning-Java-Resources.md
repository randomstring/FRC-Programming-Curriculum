# Lesson 2

## Introduction to Java and Command Based Programming.

This lesson is self-paced and is an ongoing project. You will continue
to learn and improve your programming skills for the rest of your
life. Here are some resources for getting started that are specific to
Java and programming FRC robots. Any programming experience and
practice will make you a better programmer.

## Command Based, VS Code, and Java intro

Here is a YouTube Tutorial series that is a good introduction to
