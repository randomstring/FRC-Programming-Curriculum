    + Robot.java
    + RobotMap.java
    + OI.java (xbox controllers)
    + subsystems
    + commands
    + command Groups
    + controlling motors
    + sensor input
    + drivetrains (tank, arcade style)
    + Network tables (reading/writing values) 
    + subsystems and command interaction (scheduler)
  - Missing Documentation
    + Source material:
    + Command.java
      - Command()
        + constructor will have the same name as your Command
        + call requires() for every subsystem used, to prevent
          conflicts. more than one command cannot use the same
          subsystem at the same time
	+ CAREFUL: do not put initialization code here, it belongs in initialize()
      - initialize()
        + Anything that would need to happen before the command starts.
        + Example: Getting the starting position from an encoder.
	+ CAREFUL: not to put initialize code into execute, if it only needs to be run once
	  it should be in initialize() not execute()
      - execute()
        + The action that needs to be repeated over and over again.
        + Treat this method as a single iteration of a loop.
        + will keep getting called every time through the scheduler, until 
           1) isFinished() returns true OR
	   2) the command is interupted, another command that requires the same subsystem
        + CAUTION: While this command's execute() is running, no other
          code is being run.  if this code takes too long (say more
          than 10ms) it will make other parts of the robot have
          problems. Drive may stutter. Sensors won't update quickly
          enough. controls will be sluggish and erratic. Waiting for
          input, highly iterative code, slow computation are all a
          no-no.
        + Example: Reading the values from a joystick and sending them to the drivetrain.
      - isFinished()
	+ is checked after every execute()
        + default commands should always return False
        + if execute() only runs once, then should always return True
      - end()
        + This method will run after the isFinished() method returns a true value.
        + This should contain anything that needs to happen after a command finishes.
        + Example: Set the drivetrain motors to stop.
      - interrupted()
        + This command will run if another command takes control of a subsystem that this command was using.
	+ may be different action than end() may be the same
        + Example: Setting a motor to stop
    + OI.java
      - button.whenPressed(new ExampleCommand());
	Will execute when the button is first pressed down
      - button.whenReleased(new ExampleCommand());
	Will execute when the button is first released
      - button.whileHeld(new ExampleCommand());
	Will repeatedly execute while the button is held down. The interrupted() method of the command will be called when the button is released.
      - OTHERS?
    + RobotMap.java
      - This is where you can set up all of your device port configurations.
      - This allows you to have all of your configuration information in one place.

      - comments should explain WHY not WHAT, the what should be obvious from your code. 
      - include refernces to documentation, API, etc
    + adopt a style

   - debug commands and subsystems:
     + https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/smartdashboard/l/255422-displaying-the-status-of-commands-and-subsystems
   - check for expected and unexpected values (assert statements)
   - defensive programming (ignore bad input, or just STOP)
   - check your assumptions
   - If you are confused about what the code is doing, then you don't
     understand the code or you don't understand what's going
     on. LEARN what's really happening, don't keep changing the code.
* What is it like to be a Programmer?
  - expect to spend lots of time googling and reading webpages
   - alway backup your code
     + ABC: Always Be Commiting. Use version control (github for example)
   - Use branches
     + bookmark working code, keep experimental code off the main branch
   - nothing ever works the first time
   - every line of code is an opportunity for a bug
     + off by one errors ( < vs <= )
   - study other peoples code
   - copy from the best
   - learning how to debug
     + ask for help
     + explain your problem to someone (or rubber duck)
   - typing skills are important
* Basic Physics
 - speed, acceleration, gravity, motion
   + newton's laws
 - force, momentum, energy

* Programming Projects
  - the best way to learn is to have a project, a reason to learn and use the skills
  - Clean room program last year's robot from scratch
  - add features to 2019 Robot
    + gyro for level climb
    + gyro for drive straight, field alignment
    + limit switch or hall effect for arm or stilt
